<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![App preview](https://i.ibb.co/3WLHV2n/Screenshot-2023-03-25-at-01-34-51.png)

The project runs on an algorithm I developed using the OOP approach. It works with these procedures:

- You type in the equation in the equation in the frontend input box
- On clicking the solve button, I get the equation.
- The first thing I do is to sanitize the equation and make sure it's valid
- Next, I call one of the equation solver class methods to solve the equation. To solve the equation using the following steps:
  - I remove the spaces between the equations
  - Split the equation into two by the equals symbol (`=`) into `left` and `right`
  - I check if there are brackets, expand them and replace the `left` and `right` with the expanded brackets
  - After that, I call a method to check if both sides contain a variable e.g `2x` and collect like terms by taking the variables to the left-hand side.
  - Next, I call another method to sum up all the variables and numbers on the left hand side and return them
  - If there is a number returned from the left-hand side, I either add or subtract it from both sides depending on its sign to eliminate it from the left-hand side.
  - Then, I sum up all the numbers on the right-hand side
  - Finally, I divide both sides by the coefficient the variable on the left-hand side to get my final answer
- While the sub-steps of the previous steps are being carried out, I call methods in-between to show the steps on the front-end.
- This way, I solve the problem and explain it to the user at the same time.

The algorithm can get better.
